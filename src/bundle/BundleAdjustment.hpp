/**
** Bundle Adjustment Basics:

	problem:
		min f 
		where f = sum of i,m {(u[i][j] - proj(C[j], X[i]))**2}

		where u[i][j] is the observed point X[i] by the
		camera C[j].

	def:
		r = u[i][j] - proj(C[j], X[i])
	
		given x = [c, p] with 
		c being a flat vector with all the camera parameters and 
		p being a flat vector with all the point parameters. 

		lets define û[i][j] = proj(C[j], X[i])
		then define:
		 	A[i][j] = diff(û[i][j], c[j]), and diff(û[i][j], c[k]) = 0 for every j different from k 
 		 	B[i][j] = diff(û[i][j], p[i]), and diff(û[i][j], p[k]) = 0 for every i different from k 

	U[j] = sum over i for each point i that is seen by camera j of 	A[i][j].T * A[i][j]
	V[i] = sum over j for each camera j that sees the point i of 		B[i][j].T * B[i][j]
	W[i][j] = A[i][j].T * B[i][j]

	r[i][j] = u[i][j] - û[i][j]
	e[c[j]] = sum over all i seen in camera j of A[i][j]*r[i][j]
	e[p[i]] = sum over all j that sees point i of B[i][j]*r[i][j]

	Then we can get delta x by
	[[U W], [W.T, V]] * delta(x) = flat([e[c], e[p]])

	It is possibly to get 
	(U - W*inverse(V)*W.T) = S
	with being c is 1: Compute the derivation matrix:
Aij =
∂uˆij
∂cj
, Bij =
∂uˆij
∂Xi
rij = uij − π(cj , Xi) = uij − uˆij


/**
Algorithm: Compute Sx with W, V and x
without forming S on memory:
	x1 = W.T*x
	x2 = inverse(V) * x1
	x3 = W*x2
	x4 = B*x
	Sx = x4 - x3
